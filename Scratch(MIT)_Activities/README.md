# Scratch (MIT) and Quantum Computing

Scratch is a widely popular, free programming language designed for children and young learners (and great for adult beginners too!). It uses a drag-and-drop interface and block-programming to engage learners and teach fundamental coding principles.

We've created several quantum computing animations and games on Scratch, to demonstrate quantum gates and quantum states. Each game is accessible by loading the .sb3 file, or online via the [Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27046227/).

There is a series of Scratch challenges to go along with the games.
